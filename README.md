# Questions

Real-time Question system with Flybase.io

This is in two parts, first you have the actual question area for people to enter questions, and upvote questions they like best, and second you have the dashboard where you can view questions as they come in and watch as the votes change.

Two handy things about making this real-time:

1. Viewers can see questions move up the voting line as they are upvoted
2. You can watch questions appear and get upvoted from the dashboard
